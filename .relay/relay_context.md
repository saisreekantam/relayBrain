## PROJECT SUMMARY
# Project Summary

<!-- Maintained by relay compile (coding agent + relay-sync skill). -->

## Overview

**Relay (`relay-os`)** — cross-agent project memory for Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, and Antigravity. One `.relay/` markdown brain, unified timeline, handoff file, npm CLI, stop hooks, optional MCP, and Mission Control UI.

## Tech stack

- **CLI/API:** Node 18+, Express, file-based storage (no DB server)
- **Mission Control:** Next.js 16, React 19, localStorage workspaces
- **Optional:** system `sqlite3` CLI for Copilot `state.vscdb` reads; LLM keys for `compile-ir`

## Goals

- Single npm install → `relay init`, hooks, skills, `.relay/`, Mission Control
- `relay init` starts API + UI in background; `relay serve` foreground
- Mission Control shows IR (handoff, tasks, decisions, failures), collaborators, agent routing chat
- Publish to npm; install via `npm install relay-os` then `relay init`
## CURRENT TASKS
- [x] Audit existing codebase to find insertion points for an agentic layer
- [x] Define winning hackathon strategy (autonomous-orchestration reframe)
- [x] Write 15-slide pitch deck content → `docs/PITCH.md`
- [x] Add missing `LICENSE` (MIT) and include it in `package.json` `files`
- [ ] Decide weekend hero feature: full Conductor loop vs collision detection first
- [x] User ran `npm login` (account: jester1177)
- [ ] npm publish `relay-os@0.1.0` — still 404 on registry after 2nd attempt; likely still blocked on 2FA/access-token (403). Waiting on user to confirm 2FA/token status and share final lines of publish output
- [ ] Run `npm pkg fix` to normalize `bin.relay` path (remove leading `./`) and `repository.url` (`git+` prefix) before next publish
- [ ] Re-verify `backend/node_modules` exclusion from tarball before next publish attempt
- [ ] Build Conductor vertical slice (reuses existing spawn + callLlm + timeline):
- [ ] Add `lib/relayCollision.js` (groupBy(path) over `memory.timeline`)
- [ ] Add `POST /api/orchestrate` + MCP tools (`relay_dispatch`, `relay_conflicts`)
## OPEN DECISIONS
- [ ] Weekend hero feature: full Conductor loop (think+decide+act+verify) vs collision detection first
- [ ] Live demo dispatch: rely on real Claude/Codex CLI vs deterministic replay/mock
- [ ] Whether to auto-open browser on `relay init` (currently prints URLs only)

ok we missed out on showing internal relay files like current tasks, decision , failures, handoff in the serve ui and also relay init doesnt launch the ui automatically in the start, i have to do relay serve seperately, so make it launch the ui as a backgroudn process with init or serve. add a collaborators section fo…

Briefly inform the user about the task result and perform any follow-up actions (if needed). If there's no follow-ups needed, don't explicitly say that.

All agent-facing instructions now use the `relay` npm binary (`relay init`, `relay sync`, `relay context .`, etc.) instead of `npx relay-os`.

### What changed

**Source templates** (used by `relay init` / `relay install` on any project):
- `backend/lib/relayInstall.js` — bootstrap, patched instruction blocks, Cursor …
