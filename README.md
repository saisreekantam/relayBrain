## The Human Problem: Why Relay Exists

AI coding agents are getting incredibly smart, but the way we interact with them is not smart, and is broken. Every IDE, chatbot, and agent has invented its own custom language and siloed instructions:

* **Claude** reads `CLAUDE.md`
* **Cursor** reads `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/`
* **Copilot** reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
* **Codex / CLI agents** read `AGENTS.md`
* **Antigravity** reads Artifacts

The result? Context fragmentation and developer exhaustion.

### The "Angry Monkey" Loop

> **Today:**
> 1. Monkey teaches Claude about the project. Claude learns.
> 2. Monkey switches to Cursor. Cursor is clueless.
> 3. Monkey has to teach Cursor the exact same context.
> 4. Monkey switches to a shell agent. Shell agent is hallucinating.
> 5. Monkey teaches again. Monkey angry.
> 
> **With Relay:**
> 1. Monkey teaches Relay once. Relay stores it in a structured, standard format.
> 2. Claude reads Relay.
> 3. Cursor reads Relay.
> 4. Gemini reads Relay.
> 5. Antigravity reads Relay.
> 6. Monkey happy.

This is not an AI algorithm issue—it is a **human workflow issue**. Relay solves it by being the translation layer between coding agents.

## The Vision: The Interoperability Layer

Think of **Git**. Git doesn't care whether you edit code using VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, or Emacs. Git is the shared protocol for source code history.

**Relay is the shared protocol for project intelligence.** 

```text
 Claude ────┐
 Cursor ────┼───► [ Relay ] ───► The Unified Project Brain
 Copilot ───┼───┘
 Gemini ────┘
```

Instead of lock-in to a specific editor's SQLite database or ephemeral chat history, Relay decouples context. If a better model or agent drops tomorrow, you switch instantly without losing a single drop of project history, decisions, or architectural intent.

## The Active Debate: Structured Markdown vs. RAG

A massive engineering shift is happening in AI codebase intelligence. While most platforms build complex, non-deterministic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, research and production outcomes show a surprising truth: **human-in-the-loop, structured context files beat raw vector search.**

### The Vector Trap in Production
Traditional RAG breaks your codebase into arbitrary, flattened chunks (e.g., 500-token blocks) and stores them in vector databases. For code, this is disastrous:
* **Scope Loss:** RAG retrieves a single function block but misses its import dependencies, parent class variables, or calling context.
* **Multi-Hop Failure:** Asking architectural questions (e.g., "How does authentication flow through this project?") requires global codebase reasoning. RAG cannot stitch disconnected code fragments together.

### The Long-Context & Markdown Solution
Modern models (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GPT-4o) boast context windows from 200k to 2M tokens. Recent research, such as ***"Can Long-Context Language Models Subsume Retrieval, RAG, SQL, and More?"* (arXiv:2406.13121)**, demonstrates that long-context models routinely match or outperform complex RAG systems on codebase understanding when the context is presented cohesively.

When structured logically in **Markdown**, models leverage their attention mechanisms to map relationships natively:
* Markdown files preserve hierarchical outlines (folders, files, classes, methods).
* Human developers can easily audit, edit, and curate the files.
* Changes are tracked natively via git diffs.

Relay leans directly into this paradigm. Instead of building generic vector search infrastructure, Relay focuses on generating, syncing, and translating structured markdown context files.

## How it Works: Universal IR (Intermediate Representation)

Relay works exactly like a compiler. It ingests agent-specific context files, converts them into a **Universal IR**, and translates them back out to match the native formats of whichever tools you use.

### The Lifecycle of Context

```text
  Ingest Sources                    Relay IR (Universal)                 Target Synced Formats
 ┌─────────────────┐                                                    ┌───────────────────────────┐
 │ CLAUDE.md       │ ───────┐                                     ┌───► │ CLAUDE.md                 │
 └─────────────────┘        │                                     │     └───────────────────────────┘

## The `.relay/` Directory: Human-Readable & Git-Friendly

We don't hide your project's memory in binary vector databases (`memory.db`) or cloud black-boxes. Relay structures your workspace context in human-readable Markdown files. 

Every AI agent, human developer, and version control system (Git) natively understands Markdown.

```text
your-project/
└── .relay/
    ├── project.md        # High-level overview, tech stack, and goals
    ├── architecture.md   # Structural diagrams, folder layout, and component boundaries
    ├── decisions.md      # Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and design trade-offs
    ├── current_task.md   # Active goals, TODOs, and context markers
    └── failures.md       # Anti-patterns, bugs encountered, and what NOT to do
```

### Why this structure wins:
* **Zero Lock-in:** You can view, edit, or delete memories with a simple text editor.
* **Diffable:** Every change in context is tracked in your Git history.
* **Interoperable:** Future agents can read it instantly without custom integrations.

---

## Commands

Relay features a lightweight CLI to keep your workspace aligned.

```bash
# Initialize Relay in the current workspace
relay init

# Import memory from existing .cursorrules, CLAUDE.md, or markdown files
relay import

# Automatically compile Relay IR into target agent instructions
relay sync
```

When you run `relay sync`, Relay automatically generates and updates:
* `CLAUDE.md`
* `.cursor/rules/relay.mdc`
* `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
* `AGENTS.md`

So every agent you open operates with the exact same updated project intelligence.

## Philosophy: The Moat is the Translation Layer

Vectors are becoming commodity infrastructure. Building another memory database or a slightly faster vector retrieval loop is a race to the bottom.

Relay's focus is the **translation layer**. By reverse-engineering agent-specific interfaces, instructions, and prompt-injection protocols, Relay bridges the gap between how different agents process information. 

Let the agents focus on executing code. Relay will handle the project brain.
